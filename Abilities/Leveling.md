# Leveling System

This page is created to plan out a future leveling system for the DawnPiece Mod. Keep in mind that this system is very involved and cant really be rolled out little by little so it will take a long time to accomplish.

### General Information

1. Every stat system in the game will have their own levels built in. These will be level 1-10 for each stat.
2. There will be a generic level that a player has that is the sum of all their stat levels. This is just for show, the bonuses that come with leveling are related to leveling up the stats.
3. Stats include Health, Stamina, Each Type of Haki, Each Type of Devil Fruit, Each Kind of Race and Each Kind of Class.
4. If a player switches class, race or DF then their level start at zero for each new type they use but any level they gain is preserved for old types. If they want to switch back and forth they are free to do so. The goal of this is to get players trying different races, styles and fruits without losing progress in case they ever want to switch back. Another positive is that players can continue leveling up their general level. This means the max general level is the sum of max health, max stamina, maxing all types of haki, maxing all races, maxing all classes, and maxing all devil fruits.

### Health

1. Players start with vanilla 20 health and can achieve a maximum of 500 health. Health is tied to the amount of damage received by the player.
2. While levels are cut and dry for general leveling purposes, health will increase in the background by 1 HP every 200 Damage Received.

| Level     | Health | Damage Recieved Per Level | Cumulative Damage Recieved |
|-----------|--------|-------------------        |---------------             |
| 0         | 20     | 0                         | 0                          |
| 1         | 50     | 6,000                     | 6,000                      |
| 2         | 100    | 10,000                    | 16,000                     |
| 3         | 150    | 10,000                    | 26,000                     |

| 7         | 350    | 10,000                    | 66,000                     |
| 8         | 400    | 10,000                    | 76,000                     |
| 9         | 450    | 10,000                    | 86,000                     |
| 10        | 500    | 10,000                    | 96,000                     |

### Stamina

1. Every level up of stamina increases movement speed, swim speed, fly speed, sprint speed and sprint distance. Max is 2x faster than normal speed.
2. While levels are cut and dry for leveling purposes, speed will increase in the background by 1% every 5,000M traveled.
