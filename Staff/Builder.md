# Builder Role

As a builder, you will be responsible for creating interiors, buildings and islands for the server. Please see the information below for instructions and support.

### World Edit

To make building easier, learn how to be proficient in world edit. If you are not familiar how to use it please practice in single player using this [command guide](https://minecraft-worldedit.fandom.com/wiki/Worldedit_Commands) to help teach you a bit. This will help a lot regarding cleaning, clearing, copying and pasting. If you ever mess up, remember that //undo exists. 

### Build Creations

We have a lot of builds that need to be done on the server. Most are interiors as Varian and Bruv did not put much effort into interior design for their map. Some islands they made also are not set up nicely for quests so they may need to be redesigned a bit to make space for npcs and quests. This [Builder Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FO9bZc7Klvt1jUPlhJKNtCXhVE5mfmvyrStxe3pEHkc/edit?tab=t.0) shows all of the buildings interiors we need fixed up so please look at it anytime you want to build.

### Large Creations

Some islands and ships that appear in One Piece have not been created yet. If you want to design an island or ship please build it outside of the server and we will import it in the server. Helpful tools for this are World Edit and World Painter. Please make sure to build in 1.16.5 using only Vanilla blocks. The [Island Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y9GrVu1HjYtAfYdYeuXBHSEknMmZgkntwpZwsdxO9sA/edit?tab=t.0) has a list of all the islands we would like to add over time.
