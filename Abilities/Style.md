# Style

Players will be able to choose a style that they will like to play as in game. To begin with, players will have access to choose a starter style, and maxing out a certain amount of styles will allow you to unlock more styles to use in the future. Unlockable styles will be stronger at their base value.

### Style Leveling

Style leveling is tied to the amount of experience points by the player when using any style move. Experience points are tied to damage dealt for damage moves, damage recieved for armor moves, health regeneration for heal moves, distance traveled for speed moves, and so on and so forth.<br>

Each style will have its own level save data, so if a player changes their style, they start the new style at level 0. If they change back to a style they used before, then they return to that style's level save data. A mythical style will require more experience points to level up compared to a common style.<br>

Every level up will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage. Every level up will also decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.

### Style Abilities

Each style will have passive abilities that will be available at all times. Some of these passives will include buffs and debuffs depending on the race. You start with two moves and every two levels, you unlock a style move for a maximum of 7 moves.

### Style Progression Lines

There will be 8 style progression lines that will be geared towards certain weapons of your choice, and as a result will buff their respective weapon damage output. Each style line will have its own progression system, so reaching max level on one style will only unlock one of the styles in the next tier. The following style lines are below.

1. Slash Line: Focused on Slash Weapon Related Styles
2. Bludgeon Line: Focused on Bludgeon Weapon Related Styles
3. Impact Line: Focused on Impact Weapon Related Styles
4. Pierce Line: Focused on Pierce Weapon Related Styles
