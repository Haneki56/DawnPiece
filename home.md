### Custom Gear Guide

The server contains an entire custom gear system that was created in the DawnPiece Mod. Custom Gear is designed specifically for each character. Each character will drop a helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots and a weapon if applicable to their design. We plan to make sure each character has a proper set to be dropped in the game over time. To check out the different blocks associated with the Custom Gear, check out the Blacksmith page. Specific information about types of gear can be found on their respective pages.

### Life Path Guide

There are various life paths that you can choose from in the game. To recieve the base rank in game, speak to the Life Path Recruiter at Spawn. From there you will be able to rank up through general ranks of each Life Path that you choose in game. After you will have the option to move onto Legacy Ranks. Specific information about Legacy Ranks and Life Paths including Trails Questlines and Bosses can be found on their respective pages.
