# Haki

The haki we use for our server is based on the mine mine no mi mod. Please reference their wiki page for specific information on how it works.


### Haki Bosses

We have a variety of bosses that give haki experience to players upon defeating them. Do to mine mine no mi limitations, regular players can't check their stats so please keep track of them yourself using the values listed in the chart below. Max Observation and Armament Haki levels are 300.
