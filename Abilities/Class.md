# Class

Players will be able to choose a class that they will like to play as in game. To begin with, players will have access to choose a starter class, and maxing out a certain amount of classes will allow you to unlock more classes to use in the future. Unlockable classes will be stronger at their base value.

### Class Leveling

Class leveling is tied to the amount of experience points by the player when using any class move. Experience points are tied to damage dealt for damage moves, damage recieved for armor moves, health regeneration for heal moves, distance traveled for speed moves, and so on and so forth.<br>

Each class will have its own level save data, so if a player changes their class, they start the new class at level 0. If they change back to a class they used before, then they return to that class’s level save data. A mythical class will require more experience points to level up compared to a common class.<br>

Every level up will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage. Every level up will also decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.

### Class Abilities

Each class will have passive abilities that will be available at all times. Some of these passives will include buffs and debuffs depending on the race. You start with two moves and every two levels, you unlock a class move for a maximum of 7 moves.

### Class Lines

There will be 8 class lines that will be geared towards certain weapons of your choice, and as a result will buff their respective weapon damage output. Each class line will have its own progression system, so reaching max level on one class will only unlock one of the classes in the next tier. The following class lines are below.

1. Slash Line: Focused on Slash Weapon Related Styles
2. Bludgeon Line: Focused on Bludgeon Weapon Related Styles
3. Impact Line: Focused on Impact Weapon Related Styles
4. Pierce Line: Focused on Pierce Weapon Related Styles
