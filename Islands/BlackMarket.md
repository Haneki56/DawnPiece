### Blacksmith

The Black Market has upgraded versions of every [Blacksmith](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Gear/Blacksmith) related block in the game. Please see below on what is different.

1. Mythical Forge: This operates the same way as the Upgrade Table, however legendary gear can now be upgraded to mythical gear.
2. Restoration Forge: This operates the same way as the Repair Station, however repair costs are cut in half.
3. Destiny Forge: This operates the same way as a Fate Forge, however orbs of every tier can be placed to roll for a change of obtaining random gear. The amount of orbs required increase with each tier, starting with one orb for common and uncommon, and ending with five orbs at mythical.
4. Reclamation Forge: This operates the same way as the Salvage Stand, but has a 30% payout of the upgrade cost for gear instead of 20%. Additionally, every 50 Damage Dealt or Recieved gives you an extra belly payout rather than the original value of 100.
