# Haki

There are three types of Haki in the game: Observation, Armament and Conqueror's Haki.

### Haki Leveling

The Haki Experience Counter will begin as you recieve damage for Observation and deal damage for Armament Haki. Once you reach level 10 in both of these types of Haki you will unlock Conqueror's Haki. To level up your Conqueror's Haki, you must deal damage with any Haki ability.<br>

Every level up will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage. Every level up will also decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.

### Haki Abilities

Observation and Armament Haki will start with zero moves and every two levels, you unlock a class move for a maximum of 5 moves. Upon unlocking Conqueror's Haki, you will recieve one move and unlock a move every two levels for a total of 6 moves.
