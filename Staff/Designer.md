# Designer Role

As a designer, you will be responsible for creating minecraft skins and blockbench weapon and armor models for the server. Please see the information below for instructions and support.

### Custom Gear

Custom gear are expected to be either Swords or Full Armor sets. Each character will drop one of each piece so design anything and everything that is missing from all boss NPCs that currently are using vanilla placeholder skins in the game. Some characters have different outfits in pre vs post timeskip as well as movies so make sure to keep multiple designs in mind when designing different characters skins as there are 6 tiers of weapons and armor for each character. Follow the steps below for help with submitting skins.

1. Download Blockbench or use the web app [here](https://www.blockbench.net/).
2. Check to see which bosses need skins to be made [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mN7EpQGuDJPwXUu9l0e26WoGWZnX0LN8CwZ1UdFXC1M/edit?gid=1642093025#gid=1642093025). There are weapons and armor sections on this spreadsheet so be sure to take a look at both tabs. If you decide to work on certain gear, mention you are working on it in the notes section so others know not to do the same one.
3. Once the gear is finished, be sure to name it after the characters or weapons name listed in the spreadsheet in step two and then generate .png and .json files from blockbench.
4. For weapons, drag and drop the .png and .json files into the [Work In Progress Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/19jGTmisUC8SpUEogExYR69XemCFa8ZIo). No need to drop .bbmodel files in here however you can if you would like to for safekeeping.
5. For armor, drag and drop the .png, .geo.json, and animation.json files into the [Work In Progress Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/19jGTmisUC8SpUEogExYR69XemCFa8ZIo). There should also be 32x32 (or another perfect square dimensional size) pictures of each of the 4 pieces for the hotbar icons.
6. Wait to hear back from the Admins for a quality check. If you see that your skin was deleted from the Work In Progress Folder, this means that it was loaded up and organized within our skin archive or that it was asked to be redone.

### Minecraft Skins

We will sometimes ask that you create Minecraft Skins in the event that we can't find any online that suit our needs. Be sure to follow the steps accordingly when making and submitting the skin.

1. Check this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OZb5mbb0R8JY-MvrJiuud-yTNO6lBSZmxLDW_wLCNU4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) for skins that need to be designed for the server.
2. Use whatever Minecraft Skin Building tool you like. We recommend using [Novaskin](https://minecraft.novaskin.me/) as skins from other websites tend to be a bit glitchy and don't display 100% of the time.
3. Once the skin is finished and uploaded to your novaskin account, generate a 64x64 skin link to send over to admins. It should look like this: https://t.novaskin.me/8e459f8e32933e44f3ecd8aceff1f93beca52fd885b5b9fb897252e022940fbe 
4. Place the link in the spreadsheet from step one and wait for an admin to upload it. Once the skin is saved to the NPC, it will be deleted from the spreadsheet.
