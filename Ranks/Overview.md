# Life Paths

There are various life paths that you can choose in game by speaking to the Life Path Recruiter at Spawn. You can also choose your Life Path on the Discord Server by reacting to the message in the [Ranks Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1395615888585130144)on the Discord to get the role. Each rank follows the same structure regarding leveling up.

### General Ranks & Bounty

The balance you see by using the commands /money and /bal represents the bounty you’ve accumulated so far on the server. This money is used to upgrade ⁠ranks depending on which life path you choose. You accumulate bounty by completing quests and winning events! Once you achieve the required bounty to rank up, you can type /rankup in game. Each rankup will give you a bonus.

| Rank Type     | Cumulative Bounty | Rank Bonus|
|-----------    |-------------------|-----------|
| Starting      | 0                 | None      |
| 30,000,000    | 30,000,000        | ?         |
| 100,000,000   | 130,000,000       | ?         |
| 300,000,000   | 430,000,000       | ?         |

### Legacy Ranks

Legacy Ranks are special ranks in game that can only be occupied by one player at a time. There are various ranks depending on the life path of the player. Each Legacy Rank requires the completion of a trials questline tied to that rank and a tribute given to staff. Legacy Rank Holders receive a kit specific to their rank and well as bonus similar to the general ranks. To see specific information for each life path including trials quests and bosses, refer to their respective pages.

| Legacy Rank Type  | Cumulative Bounty | Rank Bonus| Rank Kit  |
|-----------        |-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 500,000,000       | 930,000,000       | ?         | ?         |
| 1,000,000,000     | 1,930,000,000     | ?         | ?         |
| 1,500,000,000     | 3,430,000,000     | ?         | ?         |

### Rules For Legacy Ranks

1. If a rank is unclaimed and you meet the requirements, you can claim it.
2. If it's taken, you must challenge the current holder.
3. New rank holders have a 1-week grace period before they can be challenged.

2. Set a 1v1 match date with the rank holder.
3. Winner claims the rank. Challenger forfeits their tribute if they lose.
4. If the rank holder doesn't respond to a challenge within 3 days, they forfeit the rank.
