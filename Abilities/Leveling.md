# Leveling System

This page is created to plan out a future leveling system for the DawnPiece Mod. Keep in mind that this system is very involved and cant really be rolled out little by little so it will take a long time to accomplish.

### General Information

1. Every stat system in the game will have their own levels built in. These will be level 1-10 for each stat.
2. There will be a generic level that a player has that is the sum of all their stat levels. This is just for show, the bonuses that come with leveling are related to leveling up the stats.
3. Stats include Health, Stamina, Each Type of Haki, Each Type of Devil Fruit, Each Kind of Race and Each Kind of Class.
4. If a player switches class, race or DF then their level start at zero for each new type they use but any level they gain is preserved for old types. If they want to switch back and forth they are free to do so. The goal of this is to get players trying different races, styles and fruits without losing progress in case they ever want to switch back. Another positive is that players can continue leveling up their general level. This means the max general level is the sum of max health, max stamina, maxing all types of haki, maxing all races, maxing all classes, and maxing all devil fruits.

### Health

1. Players start with vanilla 20 health and can achieve a maximum of 500 health. Health is tied to the amount of damage received by the player.
2. While levels are cut and dry for general leveling purposes, health will increase in the background by 1 HP every 200 Damage Received.

| Level     | Health | Damage Recieved Per Level | Cumulative Damage Recieved |
|-----------|--------|-------------------        |---------------             |
| 0         | 20     | 0                         | 0                          |

### Races

1. Race leveling is tied to the amount of damage dealt by the player when using any Race move.
2. Each race will have its own save data. If a player changes their race, they start the new race at level 0. If they change back to a race they used before, then they return to that race’s level save data. This encourages players to max out every race if they feel the game gets repetitive by sticking to one.
3. You start with two moves and every two levels, you unlock a race move for a maximum of 7 moves. There will be passive buffs and debuffs depending on the race.
4. Every level will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage.
5. Every level will decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.
6. Players will have access to basic races to start, and maxing out a certain amount of races will allow you to unlock more races to use. For example, a player may start with Human then maxing that out will unlock Modified Human and Bucaneer, maxing out Cyborg can unlock Pacifista and Seraphim, etc. Higher level races will be stronger at their base value.

### Devil Fruits

1. Devil Fruit leveling is tied to the amount of damage dealt by the player when using any Devil Fruit move.
2. Each Devil Fruit will have its own save data. If a player changes their Devil Fruit, they start the new Devil Fruit at level 0. If they change back to a Devil Fruit they used before, then they return to that Devil Fruit’s level save data. This encourages players to max out every Devil Fruit if they feel the game gets repetitive by sticking to one.
3. You start with two moves and every two levels, you unlock a Devil Fruit move for a maximum of 7 moves for Common until Rare Fruits. Rare Fruits will simply be stronger than common, and likely have more useful abilities. Epic and above will have more abilities and be stronger as tier increases. There will be passive buffs and debuffs depending on the Devil Fruit.
4. Every level will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage.
5. Every level will decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.
6. Awakenings are yet to be figured out, but they can be when the player reaches level 10 or after unlocking level 10 you can use awakening shards for an increased damage buff. If its the former, awakening shards can be used to give you a set amount of EXP (damage dealt) and if its the latter.
