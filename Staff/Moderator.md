# Helper and Moderator Roles

As a helper and moderator, you will be responsible for assisting new players in getting them started, being the police force for the server, answering tickets to get necessary info until an admin takes care of it, helping with organizing server information such as the wiki and looking over the discord embeds and commands to make sure they’re up to date.

### Moderation Info

As part of your job requirements, you're expected to keep an eye on players' activity and movements to an extent. In the event that you come across someone who is breaking the rules and feel the need to jail or ban them, then send a message in the Staff chat so that admins are in the loop.

### Conduct

Always handle yourself with dignity when using the One Piece Adventures at Sea name. It's fine if you mess around and have fun, but treat people with sincerity. We do not tolerate any conduct that appears in the form of bullying and general toxicity.

### Handling Tickets

1. If players open a ticket without saying anything or not giving us the information we need to help them, you can tell them to follow the specific format so an Admin can take care of it when they are available.
2. If someone properly follows the format right away, thank them for doing so and tell them that an admin will take care of them when available.
3. You can close tickets by typing /Close in the ticket. Do this if the issue was taken care of and an Admin forgot to close it or if a player opened a ticket to ask a question that could have been asnwered in Q&A.

Note: Remember that you do not have to answer tickets. If you are unsure on how to handle it, then you can wait for another staff member to take care of it and learn from the way they handle tickets. You can also tell the player that an Admin will take care of their issue or question if you can't or don't know how to handle the situation.
