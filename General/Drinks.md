# Drinks

This DawnPiece Mod has a variety of drink items from the One Piece World. The goal of drinks is to give you a buff at the expense of a debuff, effectively acting as mixed effect potions.

### Drink Merchants

There are various merchants that sell drinks in game. Each island guide page list them in the merchants section, so make sure to take a look once you visit an island. Listed below are the general merchants. Keep in mind some islands have named versions of a general merchant. An example this is Makino on Foosha Village being a Bartender.
