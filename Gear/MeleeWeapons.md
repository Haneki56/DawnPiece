# Melee Weapons

The DawnPiece mod has custom weapons that drop from NPCs. As you progress through the story, you will be able to unlock the ability to fight a wider variety of characters that drop their own gear. Please see the information below to learn about how the custom gear works.

### Weapon Stats

All melee weapons will have base Damage stats for dealing raw damage and an Attack Speed multiplier that dictates how fast they can swing their weapon in a second. There are 6 Tiers for Gear: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary and Mythical. You can increase the tier of the weapon by upgrading them at an upgrade table. There are 5 classes of weapons referred to as Basic, Grade, Skillful, Great and Supreme. Supreme blades are the highest damage class while Basic is the lowest damage class. Attack Speed remains unchanged amongst classes, but it will increase when upgrading the tier.

| Tier      | Basic Damage  | Grade Damage  | Skillful Damage   | Great Damage  | Supreme Damage| Attack Speed  |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Common    | 6             | 6             | 7                 | 8             | 8             | 1.5           |
| Uncommon  | 12            | 13            | 14                | 15            | 16            | 1.75          |

### Weapon Types

There are 6 types of melee weapons. For now, the type does nothing in game but we plan to add special effects depending on the type in future releases. Some armor set bonuses will give damage bonuses depending on the type of weapon equipped.

| Type Name     | Weapons Included                        |
|---------------|-----------                              |
| Slash         | Swords, Katanas, Scythes, Claws, etc.   |
| Bludgeon      | Maces, Axes, Bats, Pipes, Hammers, etc. |
| Pierce        | Knives, Hooks, Daggers, Spears, etc.    |
| Impact        | Gloves, Fists, Gauntlets, etc.          |
| Float         | Umbrellas, etc.                         |
| Pull          | Whips, Ropes, etc.                      |

### Weapon Upgrading

To upgrade your gear, you need to pay a certain amount of belly, have a certain amount of damage dealt with the weapon, and input the required upgrade orb. These values are different depending on the weapon tier and class, however if you place your weapon inside the GUI, the upgrade table will tell you what you need for the upgrade. Please see the following chart for a reference. Mythical weapons cannot be upgraded since they are the final tier.

| Tier      | Damage Dealt  | Orb Needed| Basic Cost| Grade Cost| Skillful Cost | Great Cost| Supreme Cost  |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| Common    | 4,000         | Uncommon  | 3,200     | 3,400     | 3,600         | 3,800     | 4,000         |
| Uncommon  | 20,000        | Rare      | 16,000    | 17,000    | 18,000        | 19,000    | 20,000        |
| Rare      | 100,000       | Epic      | 80,000    | 85,000    | 90,000        | 95,000    | 100,000       |
| Epic      | 500,000       | Legendary | 400,000   | 425,000   | 450,000       | 475,000   | 500,000       |
| Legendary | 2,500,000     | Mythical  | 2,000,000 | 2,125,000 | 2,250,000     | 2,375,000 | 2,500,000     |

### Weapon Repairing

The durability of your weapon is shown under the inventory icon, and the exact amount is shown in the tooltip when highlighting the weapon in your inventory. Once the durability of the item reaches zero, it will not break however the weapon will not do any damage. You will see a message appear on your screen that tells you to repair your weapon when it breaks.

Every time you hit an entity with your sword, the durability decreases by one. To repair gear, you must put your gear in a Repair Station found anywhere where there is a blacksmith in game. It will cost you 1 Belly to repair 10 durability. The cost always rounds up, so to repair 1-10 durability it will cost 1 Belly, 11-20 durability it will cost 2 Belly, and so on. You don't have to wait until durability reaches zero and can repair your weapon anytime so it's best to do it before long battles.

| Tier      | Durability| Repair Cost at Zero|
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Common    | 400       | 40 Belly      |
| Uncommon  | 800       | 80 Belly      |
| Rare      | 1,600     | 160 Belly     |
| Epic      | 3,200     | 320 Belly     |
| Legendary | 6,400     | 640 Belly     |
| Mythical  | 12,800    | 1,280 Belly   |
