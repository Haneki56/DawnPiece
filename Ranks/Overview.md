# Life Paths

There are various life paths that you can choose by typing /dp ranks in game. Simply select the rank from the list and your in game suffix will change to reflect that choice. You can also choose your Life Path on the Discord Server by reacting to the message in the [Ranks Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1395615888585130144) on the Discord Server to get the role. Each rank follows the same structure regarding leveling up.

### General Ranks & Bounty

The balance you see by using the command /dp bounty represents the bounty you’ve accumulated so far on the server. This bounty is used to upgrade ⁠ranks depending on which life path you choose. You accumulate bounty by completing quests and winning events! Once you achieve the required bounty to rank up, you will see your suffix change in game along with a message in chat. Each rankup will give you a bonus. If you want to see how you fare compared to the rest of the server, type /dp bounty list for the rankings.

| Rank Type     | Rank Bonus                    |

### Legacy Ranks

Legacy Ranks are special ranks in game that can only be occupied by one player at a time. There are various ranks depending on the life path of the player. Each Legacy Rank requires the completion of a trials questline tied to that rank and a tribute given to a staff member. Legacy Rank Holders receive a kit specific to their rank and well as bonus similar to the general ranks. To see specific information for each life path including trials quests and bosses, refer to their respective pages.
