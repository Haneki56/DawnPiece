# Devil Fruits

Players will have access to use Devil Fruits in the game. Unlike races and classes, devil fruits are not automatically accessible and each player will have to get their hands on one.

### Getting A Devil Fruit

There are four main ways to get a Devil Fruit.

1. Buying Devil Fruits: You can use in-game currency that you get from killing enemies and completing quests to buy Crate Keys from the merchants at Goa Kingdom, which you can then use to roll for a random fruit depending on it's tier. 
2. Earning Devil Fruits: Some bosses have a low chance of dropping fragments of their devil fruits. You can farm these bosses and trade their fragments in for the entire fruit to the fragment traders at Goa Kingdom.
3. Trading Devil Fruits: Trading with or buying fruits from other players in the Market Channels on Discord or in game is a great way to get a devil fruit. You can also sell your possessions to other players to save up for a fruit or even a crate key.
4. Winning Devil Fruits: There may be occasional events and giveaways where you can win a devil fruit! We don't do these often and they come at random times so keep an eye out on the [Events Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1388360081640521850) in the Discord.

### Devil Fruit Leveling

Devil Fruit leveling is tied to the amount of damage dealt by the player when using any Devil Fruit move. Each Devil Fruit will have its own level save data, so if a player changes their Devil Fruit, they start the new Devil Fruit at level 0. If they change back to a Devil Fruit they used before, then they return to that Devil Fruit’s level save data. A mythical Devil Fruit will require more experience points to level up compared to a common Devil Fruit.<br>

Every level up will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage. Every level up will also decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.

### Devil Fruit Abilities

Each Common, Uncommon and Rare Devil Fruit will start with two moves and every two levels, you unlock a Devil Fruit move for a maximum of 7 moves. Even though they have the same amount of moves, Rare Fruits will hit harder than Common Fruits. Epic Tier and above will have more abiltities at their disposal. Some of these abilities may be unlockable on odd levels, while others can have multiple abilities unlocked at the same level depending on the tier and fruit.

### Devil Fruit Awakenings

Awakenings are yet to be figured out, but I will list a couple ideas to brainstorm. 

1. When the player reaches level 10 the fruit is considered awakened. If you farm awakening shards, they can be used to give you a set amount of EXP (damage dealt) by eating them.
2. After reaching level 10, you can use awakening shards for an increased damage buff. This would work similar to how we require a set amount of awakening shards to buff. Some fruits could also get an extra move depending on the fruit.
