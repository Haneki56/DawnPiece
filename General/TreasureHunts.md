# Treasure Hunts

The Treasure Hunt system is exactly what it sounds like - a hunt for hidden treasure scattered across specific islands!

### How It Works

Each island contains a variety of Treasure Hunt NPCs. These NPCs provide clues, misdirections, or direct leads to the treasure. Every time you interact with one, their dialogue may change so keep talking to them! Some NPCs may direct you to others who know more, others may intentionally mislead you, and a lucky few might reveal the true location of the treasure or a false location!

### Dynamic Dialogues

Certain dialogues are only available during specific in-game hours, so timing matters! Each NPC also has multiple dialogs so make sure to talk to them more than once. Additionally, some treasure locations may turn out to be decoys, hiding nothing of value. However, each site can contain multiple chests, so search thoroughly.

### Chests & Clues

Each chest has a sign above it indicating whether the treasure has already been looted, or you’ve found the real treasure! If you successfully discover the treasure, notify an admin immediately so we can prepare a new treasure hunt for that island.

### Secret Entrances

All treasure locations are well hidden so simply flying around won’t help. Entrances are concealed by a special DawnPiece block called a Secret Block. These blocks look identical to the surrounding terrain but can be passed through leading you through to the entrance.

### Treasures

Every island will have a 100,000 Belly Bag, a Runic Stone, and an Island Specific Treasure. The belly can be spent as usual once found, while the runic stones will be required to be collected to access the Black Market and Island Specific Treasures can be sold on the Black Market for high value items!
