# Runes

Runes are basically Mythical Tier Set Bonuses that can be purchased on the [Black Market](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Islands/BlackMarket) and applied to each Mythical Armor Piece for a Total of 5 Set Bonuses including the original Set Bonus. Please see the [Set Bonus Page](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Gear/SetBonus) and refer to the Mythical columns of each chart to determine the Rune Bonus that will apply. These are very expensive as they are designed to be items to be purchased for End Game Players.

### Applying Runes

Runes can be applied at a Rune Forge which is accessible at the [Black Market Blacksmith](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Islands/BlackMarket?id=blacksmith). The are certain requirements and limitations to applying runes. Please see below before applying them or attempting to apply them.

1. You cannot apply a rune with the same original set bonus of the mythical armor. For example, if the armor set bonus is Swift Stride, then the Rune Forge blocks you from applying a Swift Stride Rune.
2. You must have at least three mythical armor pieces equipped in order to apply a rune. This is designed to make sure you get a full mythical set before being able to apply runes to your gear. The Rune Forge blocks you from applying the rune if at least 3 Mythical Armor Pieces aren't equipped.
3. You cannot equip two armor pieces with the same Rune Bonus. The Rune Forge blocks you from applying the rune if one of of your three equipped pieces has the same bonus.
4. All four Rune Bonuses and the Set Bonus all must be different. If you try to bypass step three by applying a rune bonus to armor with the same bonus as an unequipped gear piece, then you simply cannot equip that piece since the game sends it right back to your inventory. Be careful when applying a Rune you have already applied before.
