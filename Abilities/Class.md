# Class

Players will be able to choose a class that they will like to play as in game. To begin with, players will have access to choose a starter class, and maxing out a certain amount of classes will allow you to unlock more classes to use in the future. Unlockable classes will be stronger at their base value.

### Class Leveling

Class leveling is tied to the amount of damage dealt by the player when using any class move. Each class will have its own level save data, so if a player changes their class, they start the new class at level 0. If they change back to a class they used before, then they return to that class’s level save data. A mythical class will require more experience points to level up compared to a common class.<br>

Every level up will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage. Every level up will also decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.

### Class Abilities

Each class will start with two moves and every two levels, you unlock a class move for a maximum of 7 moves.
