## Getting Started

The purpose of the game is to go through the storyline in One Piece, similar to the way the Straw Hats go through their journey! Upon joining the server, you'll wind up at [Spawn Island](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Islands/SpawnIsland). Talk to the NPCs there to learn about the server. There will also be a Teleporter NPC there to take you wherever you need to go as long as you have unlocked the island.

First, you should teleport to [Foosha Village](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Islands/FooshaVillage) and start your journey! As soon as you arrive there, talk to Luffy to start the main quest. Each island going forward will have a main questline, so to unlock the next island, complete the main questline of the island you are currently on. The option for the next island will be available in the Teleporter interface.

We recommend you use your starter gear that you received when spawning into the server to help fight bosses. Be sure to also take a look around [Goa Kingdom](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Islands/GoaKingdom) since you will often go there to use the shops and essential NPCs like bankers for storage, currency exchange, food merchants, etc.

## Questing Basics

Every island has the main quest giver near the area you initially teleport to. Speak to them to begin the quest. Once you complete the first part of the quest, the next part will appear in your quest log until you complete the final part. Upon completion, you will unlock the warp for the next island. Simply speak to the final NPC in the questline to warp to the next island. Upon completion, the island will unlock within the Teleporter NPC as well so you can access it at any time.

You will notice that islands also have side quests. The quest giver NPCs are scattered around so you are encouraged to adventure around each island you visit. Most side quests are only specific to their island, however some will require you to travel around the One Piece world while others may give you access to new locations upon completion.

## Getting Gear

You will get a free set of starter gear the moment you land in the server. This should help you defeat the early bosses and move through the storyline in a smoother fashion. This gear can also be [repaired](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Gear/Blacksmith?id=repair-station) and [upgraded](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Gear/Blacksmith?id=upgrade-table) so hold onto it as you will only get the one set.

Armor and weapons also drop from NPCs. As you progress through the story, you will be able to unlock the ability to fight a wider variety of characters that drop their own gear. For more information on how the gear system works and the list of gear that drops from various bosses, check out the [Gear Guide](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Gear/Overview) and [Island Guide](https://haneki56.github.io/DawnPiece/#/Islands/Overview).

If you're lucky, another player may be selling a weapon or armor piece you are looking for so keep an eye on the [Item Search Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1394218892330537103) to see if there's anything that you can afford.

## Server Currency

The main currency is Belly. It is used to purchase items or commodities from a variety of shops or other players. Belly can be converted into higher and lower volumes by talking to the Bank Teller NPC at Goa Kingdom and various other islands with banks.

1. All bosses drop belly based on their difficulty, so defeating them is a great way to earn belly.
2. Complete quests. Rewards will get better as the game progresses. Questlines can be repeated weekly, so make sure to do them often. If you complete a questline, the payout is equal to defeating all of the bosses that are a part of the questline. 
3. Selling useful items such as swords, armor and devil fruits to other players and to merchants in game that are set up to purchase items.
4. Salvaging unused gear is another way to earn quick belly. 

## Devil Fruits

1. Buying Devil Fruits: You can use in-game currency that you get from killing enemies and completing quests to buy Crate Keys from the merchants at Goa Kingdom which you can then use to roll for a random fruit depending on it's tier. 
2. Earning Devil Fruits: Some bosses have a low chance of dropping fragments of their devil fruits. You can farm these bosses and trade their fragments in for the entire fruit to the fragment traders at Goa Kingdom.
3. Trading Devil Fruits: Trading with or buying fruits from other players in the Market Channels on Discord or in game is a great way to get a devil fruit. You can also sell your possessions to other players to save up for a fruit or even a crate key.
4. Winning Devil Fruits: There may be occasional events and giveaways where you can win a devil fruit! We don't do these often and they come at random times so keep an eye out on the [Events Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1388360081640521850) in the Discord.
5. Removing Your Devil Fruit: You can talk to the Devil Fruit Remover at Goa Kingdom to remove your devil fruit for a price. Be sure that you want to remove your fruit because the change is permanent. If you have a Yami Yami No Mi combination with another fruit, both fruits will be removed in this process.

## Faction World

The Faction World is a free roam version of the One Piece Map used in the Pirate World! Explore the faction world to find an island or ship out in the ocean to claim for your crew and build a base. You can collect blocks there to use to build bases, or purchase blocks in the Pirate World to aid your building.

You can access the Faction World by speaking with the Teleporter at Spawn. While in the Faction World, you can use /rtp to randomly teleport around a 3,000 block radius from the start point. The entire faction world radius is much larger so hide your base far away to protect it from raids! 

The Faction World was designed so players can PvP to their hearts content. Players are allowed to kill each other and raid other crews bases here freely. Keep inventory is off in the faction world so be careful when coming into contact with other players, lava and fall damage as you will lose your stuff. 

## Crews

There is a Factions System in the game where you can start or join a crew. Type /f help in game for a list of commands. Be sure to check the [Crew Recruitment Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1408560501700431943) for any crews that are actively recruiting.

New members are automatically recruits; however, they can be promoted to members and officers. Members can use chests, doors and build on claimed land and officers can claim land, invite new members, kick crew members and decide relations with other crews. The more power your crew has, the more land you can claim. Power is attained by staying alive and the max power a crew can have depends on their member count. See the list of command below.

1. Start a Crew: /f create (crew name)
2. Join a Crew: /f join (crew name) 
3. Claim Crew Land: /f claim
4. Set Crew Home: /f sethome
5. Teleport to Faction Base: /f home
6. Invite a Player: /f invite (player name) 
7. Kick a Player: /f kick (player name) 
8. Promote a Player: /f promote (player name)
9. Ally Another Crew: /f ally (crew name)
10. Truce Another Crew: /f truce (crew name)
11. Enemy Another Crew: /f enemy (crew name)
12. Disband Crew: /f disband

## Houses

You are not allowed to own a home in the pirate world. We have tried donation systems for individual homes, and legacy rank homes in the past however upkeep with these systems was too strenuous on staff. We prefer to focus our time updating the server and creating events. You may build homes in the faction world as you please but they may be raided so be careful about where you place your homes. 

## Storage

There are a variety of options to store your items. Safe storage that is untouchable by other players is limited to Ender Chests, Banks, and Backpacks. You may stumble across chests and other items in the pirate world where you may store your items, however storing at these locations is prohibited. This rule is for your sake, as we are constantly editing interiors and landscapes. If you decide to store somewhere in the pirate world, and the blocks are deleted, then staff is not held responsible for your loss.

1. Ender chests work exactly as they would in vanilla. Anywhere you open one, you can access a single chests worth of shared inventory space for safe storage. In the server, you can find these at every bank. Certain donation ranks can also access /echest from anywhere.
2. Safes are DawnPiece modded blocks that act exactly like ender chests, however are double chests and have a separate inventory from ender chests. Certain donation ranks will be given a Wallet to access their bank from anywhere. Wallets can not be dropped on death, even in the faction world.
3. Everyone gets a small backpack at start, and has the option to one time purchase a large backpack on the donation store. Similar to wallets, backpacks can not be dropped on death, even in the faction world.
4. The rest of your items can be limitlessly stored in the faction world. Be careful as other players can steal these items if you are raided, so store your most valuable items using the methods mentioned above.
