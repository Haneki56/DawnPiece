# Race

Players will be able to choose a race that they will like to play as in game. To begin with, players will have access to choose a starter race, and maxing out a certain amount of races will allow you to unlock more races to use in the future. Unlockable races will be stronger at their base value.

### Race Leveling

Race leveling is tied to the amount of experience points by the player when using any race move. Experience points are tied to damage dealt for damage moves, damage recieved for armor moves, health regeneration for heal moves, distance traveled for speed moves, and so on and so forth.<br>

Each race will have its own level save data, so if a player changes their race, they start the new race at level 0. If they change back to a race they used before, then they return to that race’s level save data. A mythical race will require more experience points to level up compared to a common race.<br>

Every level up will increase damage, protection, range or other positive stats depending on the move. For example, a damage move will start with original damage and when it reaches level 10 it will do 100% of the damage. Every level up will also decrease cooldown, debuffs, and other negative stats depending on the move. For example, a move may have a cooldown of 15 seconds and when its level 10 it drops to 5 seconds losing 1 second per level.

### Race Abilities

Each race will have passive abilities that will be available at all times. Some of these passives will include buffs and debuffs depending on the race. You start with two moves and every two levels, you unlock a race move for a maximum of 7 moves.
