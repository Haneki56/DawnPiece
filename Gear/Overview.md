# Gear Guide

The server contains an entire gear system that was created in the DawnPiece Mod. Gear is designed specifically for each character. Each character will drop a helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots and a weapon if applicable to their design. We plan to make sure each character has a proper set to be dropped in the game over time. To check out the different blocks associated with the Custom Gear, check out the Blacksmith page. Specific information about types of gear can be found on their respective pages below.
