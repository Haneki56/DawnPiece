# Blacksmiths

Blacksmiths are Essential NPCs in game located at various islands that give you information about the functions of the blocks located there. To see which island has a Blacksmith NPC, look through the Essential NPCs section for each island in the Island Guide. Every Blacksmith location has four different blocks that have various functions: Upgrade Table, Repair Station, Salvage Stand and Fate Forge. Please see the sections below for more information on each block. When interacting with each block, be careful from other players becuase they can steal anything you add to the interface.

### Upgrade Table

To upgrade your gear, you need to pay a certain amount of belly, have a certain amount of damage dealt with the weapon, and input the required upgrade orb. These values are different depending on the weapon tier and class, however if you place your weapon inside the GUI, the upgrade table will tell you what you need for the upgrade. You can also see the requirements in the other sections on the Custom Gear Guide.

### Repair Station

To repair your gear, you need to pay 1 Belly for every 10 units of durability. You can wait until zero durability to repair, or repair anytime between. Weapons will never break on zero durability so you don't need to be overly cautious about losing a hard earned weapon, however the weapon will do zero damage at zero durability. You can also see more specifics on repair costs and durability levels in the other sections on the Custom Gear Guide.

### Fate Forge

While the orbs are primarily used for upgrading weapons, there is a Common Orb that is not used for upgrades. If you get your hands on a Common Orb, you can insert it in the Fate Forge and click the button to roll for a random Common Gear Piece. If you are lucky, you can get a common version of a high quality weapon or armor piece to upgrade over time. 

### Salvage Stand

The Salvage Stand is designed to compensate you for weapons you don't want or can't sell. The payout functions are based on the Tier, Durability and Damage Dealt (Weapon) or Damage Recieved (Armor) of each gear piece. The payout for salvaging common weapons is 50 Belly, while the rest of the tiers are 10% of their upgrade cost. For every One Durability that is subtracted from the total, One Belly will be subtracted from the total payout. For every 100 Damage Dealt or Damage Recieved, One Belly will be added to the total payout you recieve for salvaging the gear piece. You can see the payouts on the interface as you add an item to the Salvage Stand.
