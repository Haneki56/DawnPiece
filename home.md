Welcome to the official wiki for the DawnPiece Mod and One Piece Adventures at Sea Minecraft Server! Here youâ€™ll find information about a varitey of things related to the mod and Minecraft server. Below you will find some further information about the main contents of the Wiki. Use the sidebar to navigate your way around!

### Island Guide

The island guide is a collection of pages describing the contents of each island that you can access in the story. Each channel will have information about quests, bosses, merchants, essential NPCs and possibly other information if it's important to know. We will not share overly specific information such as boss drop percentages. All questlines can be repeated weekly unless otherwise noted.

### Custom Gear Guide

The server contains an entire custom gear system that was created in the DawnPiece Mod. Custom Gear is designed specifically for each character. Each character will drop a helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots and a weapon if applicable to their design. We plan to make sure each character has a proper set to be dropped in the game over time. To check out the different blocks associated with the Custom Gear, check out the Blacksmith page. Specific information about gear can be found on their respective pages.

### Life Path Guide

There are various life paths that you can choose from in the game. To recieve the base rank in game, speak to the Life Path Recruiter at Spawn. From there you will be able to rank up through general ranks of each Life Path that you choose in game. After you will have the option to move onto Legacy Ranks. Specific information about Legacy Ranks and Life Paths including Trails Questlines and Bosses can be found on their respective pages.
