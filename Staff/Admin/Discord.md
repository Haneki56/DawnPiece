# Discord Tools & Bot Tips

This page explains everything a server administrator needs to know about organizing the discord.

## Discord Channel Tools

1. When formatting the channel category names, we use a custom font found [here](https://coolsymbol.com/cool-fancy-text-generator.html). Once you're on the website, input the text you want the font changed for, scroll down to where it says "Bold Font" on the left side and then click "Copy" on the right side. You can then paste it into discord.

2. When formatting the channel names, we use a custom divider bar to separate the channel emoji and text found [here](https://www.i2symbol.com/symbols/line). Once you're on the website, click the image for "Heavy Vertical Line Symbol", and then click "Copy" on the top of the page. You can then paste it into discord.

## Discord Tips

1. You can create events in discord. Whether it’s regarding PvP, devil fruit hunts, or other events it’s pretty easy to set up. Just scroll to the top of the channel list, click events and click create new event.

2. If the bot in the [Minecraft Server Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1388455130780663808) ever goes down or stops refreshing, you can manually refresh it [here](https://ismcserver.online/dashboard/bot/1385526041807949855) by clicking the refresh data button. All information should be populated so there isn't a need to change anything else. If it doesn’t work let Haneki know.

## MEE6 Tips

Click [here](https://mee6.xyz/en/dashboard/1385526041807949855/) to access the MEE6 dashboard for our server.

### Polls

You can create polls for the [Polls Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1388360135247790140) using MEE6. The general layout is already set up, you just need to type /poll to make it and /poll-end to end it. Be sure to use those commands in the polls channel as the command creates a poll where you use it. 

### Giveaways

You can create giveaways for the [Events Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1388360081640521850) using MEE6. An example giveaway is setup to see how it works, but feel free to edit it or duplicate it and create a new one. Follow the steps and once finished click publish.

### Embeds & Reaction Roles

All Embeds & Reaction Roles are designed as organized messages that appear in many of the Info and Staff Channels. When creating new embeds, make sure that the images, color hex codes, and font style match the rest of the embeds or reaction roles that appear in that channel.

### Custom Commands

All custom commands should follow the same basic formatting as the rest of the others. You can achieve this by duplicating an already created command and changing the text and information related to the new command. A list of every custom command can be found in the [FAQ Channel](https://discord.com/channels/1385526041807949855/1394162921441067119) for a reference.

### Other MEE6 Plugins

Other plugins such as welcome, moderator, timers, tickets and levels rarely need to be touched besides checking for information updates and whatnot. These should be viewed once every few months to ensure the information is accurate.
