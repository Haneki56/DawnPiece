# Spawn Island Guide

This is the first island you start on when you join the server. There are no quests or bosses associated with Spawn Island, however you will be able to talk to some Essential NPCs to get a feel for the server. When you die in battle, you will also return to this location. You can also teleport back to any island you've unlocked from here.
